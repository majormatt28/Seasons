# Seasons
Seasons is a react app I created to determine the season you are in based on your location. Currently it only displays between summer and winter. 

# Getting Started

1) Download the files onto your computer in a specify folder of your choosing.
2) Using your Terminal on your computer, locate the file by using the cd command (Change directory).
3) Once you cd to the seasons app, you want to use the command npm start to open the app on the web browser.
4) Then when the website loads accept that you want to have your location accessed.
5) When you have accepted it the website will load with either a "brr its chilly" message indicating it's winter or "Let's hit the beach" indicating its summer.

Ideally if you do not want your location to be accessed, you could have it be hardcoded. Please follow the steps below.

1) When asked for your location you deny it.
2) Next right click the page to inspect it.
3) Scroll over to console.
4) Once there, check to see if the console drawer is open. If not look for 3 dots towards the right side of the bar.
5) When it opens you should see a command that says show console drawer. Click it.
6) Then when it's open scroll to senses and you will see location.
7) Use the drop down bar to look for locations to override the location. 

At that point everything will be exactly as it were in the getting started table.
